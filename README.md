### Scenario:
You: “Hello Mr.Arthur!”


Mr.Mickey Arthur: “Hi there! I was just thinking of meeting you? I have an idea that I
need a personalized application for myself”


You: “Aha…. Tell me about it!”


Mr. Mickey Arthur: “Well I need a web based software for me to see some weather
details, although there are many applications, for this one I have a big use-case for
the future”


You: “There are so much you can do with weather data, what are you thinking as
your immediate requirements?”


Mr. Mickey Arthur: “Well at the moment I want to have a login so that anyone else
cannot access the application. Then once I get in I want to see todays’ weather in
Colombo.”
“I should be able to search from any latitude and longitude and get the weather
details of an area.”
Also I need a weather forecast for next three days in the same page”
“When I click on view more it should show me the weather forecast for the whole
week”


You: “Good News that’s totally doable! Do you have any thoughts on the UI?”

Mr. Mickey Arthur: “I want it to be nice and attractive, that’s it! You can be creative
with it”
If possible can you host it and send me the URL once it’s done?


You: “Sure I’ll take around 2 days to do this application features you described. I can
use a free hosting provider like Heroku and send you the link, along with the
credentials”


Mr. Mickey Arthur: “Thanks a lot! So I will expect it in next 36 - 48 Hours?”


You: “Sure! Well also I’ll upload the code base to google drive and submit all of them
via this form.”


Mr. Mickey Arthur: Do let me know in case if you need more time via hr@loonslab.com


Hint: You can use weather details from https://openweathermap.org
